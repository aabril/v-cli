# v-cli

This is more likely a dummy repo, for now.

The goal is to learn more about v-lang.

V is a statically typed compiled programming language designed for building maintainable software.


## Goals

- [x] Create a simple cli and add subcommands
- [x] use modules

- [ ] Do a request to any API, and show it up on the stdout
- [ ] Add a few tests to see how it works
- [ ] Implement a word counting for each file on a folder to try concurrency

More learnings coming.
